        Interior design is constantly evolving, blending technology with comfort and sustainability. As we look towards 2025, minimalism continues to stand as a pillar of modern aesthetics, but with a warmer, more human touch.
        1. Emphasize Negative Space: Let your rooms breathe. Don't feel the need to fill every corner.
        2. Natural Palettes: Use earth tones—terracotta, sage green, and warm ochres.
        3. Multi-functional Furniture: Pieces that serve multiple purposes are essential for minimalist living.
        4. Focus on Quality: Choose one high-quality piece over five mediocre ones.
        Minimalism isn't about having nothing; it's about having exactly what you need and nothing more.

        Sustainability is no longer a luxury; it's a necessity. Homeowners are increasingly looking for ways to reduce their environmental footprint without sacrificing style.

        2. Recycled Glass Countertops: Beautiful, unique, and highly sustainable.
        3. Non-Toxic Paints: Improve your indoor air quality by choosing low-VOC or zero-VOC options.
        4. Reclaimed Wood: Add character and history to your space while saving trees.
        The future of design is green, and it starts with the materials we choose for our homes.

      excerpt: "The right lighting can change everything. Here's our guide to layering light like a pro.",

        Many people underestimate the power of lighting. It's the "invisible" element that can make a room feel cozy, clinical, or dramatic.
        1. Layer Your Lighting: Combine ambient, task, and accent lighting for a dynamic feel.
        2. Choose the Right Color Temperature: Warm light (2700K-3000K) is best for bedrooms and living rooms.
        3. Dynamic Dimmers: Give yourself control over the mood of your space.
        4. Statement Fixtures: A well-chosen chandelier or lamp acts as a functional piece of art.
        Mastering lighting is the fastest way to elevate your interior design game.
